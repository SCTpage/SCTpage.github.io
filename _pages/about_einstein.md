## **Instructions for Collaboration**  

To collaborate with our organization, you have two options available:  

---

### **1. Participation in Open Science Projects**  

You can request to join one of the open science projects available on our platform.  
Each project requires:  
- **Mandatory skills:** These must be demonstrated through a specific test designed for the respective initiative.  
- **Recommended skills:** While not mandatory, they may increase your chances of being selected.  

**Additional Information:**  
- Each project has a predefined limit of collaborators, established by the project leader.  
- Activities are carried out using the **GitHub platform** and related tools, so having an active GitHub account is essential.  
- It is highly recommended to submit **monthly progress reports** detailing project advancements. These reports:
  - Facilitate tracking.
  - Grant visibility points to enhance your profile within the community.  

**Inactivity Protocol:**  
- If a project goes without reports for **three consecutive months**, it will be automatically archived.  
- To request reactivation, you must send a formal proposal validated by the project leader to **sciti.ceo@gmail.com**, using the subject line:  
  **“Reactivate project: [project name]”**.  
  - The email must include a **two-month work schedule** specifying planned activities to prevent further inactivity.  

**Collaborating with Predefined Teams:**  
- Project leaders may choose to work with a **predefined team** instead of holding public calls for collaborators.  
- In this case, the leader must send an email to **sciti.ceo@gmail.com** with:  
  - The **names of the team members**.  
  - Their respective **GitHub usernames**.

### **2. Project Leadership**

2. A detailed **description of the project’s objectives and scope**.

4. A list of **recommended skills**.  

These elements will be published on the platform to announce the call for collaborators.  

**Applicant Recommendations:**  
- Prior experience in open science projects.

## **Weekly Repository Backups**  

To ensure data integrity and foster accountability, **SCI-T will perform a `git clone` of all active projects weekly**.  
- These clones will be stored in an internal repository and will **not be published as official SCI-T projects**.  
- The purpose of these backups is to maintain a comprehensive archive of all projects under development within the organization.
