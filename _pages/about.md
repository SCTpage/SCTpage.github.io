   **Application:** Development of technological tools.

3. **[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/):**

## **General Recommendations for the Community**
- **Public Projects:** Use open licenses like CC BY or GPL to maximize impact and collaboration.  
- **Private Projects:** Opt for licenses like CC BY-NC or proprietary licenses if temporary protection is needed, but consider releasing the work later to align with SCI-T values.  
- **Transparency:** All participants should agree on the license before starting a project.  

This framework not only fosters collaboration but also ensures that everyone’s rights are protected. Let’s keep driving progress in science and technology together!
