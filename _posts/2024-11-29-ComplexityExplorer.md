# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
# toc:
#   - name: Equations
#     # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
#     # subsections:
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
#   - name: Citations
#   - name: Footnotes
#   - name: Code Blocks
